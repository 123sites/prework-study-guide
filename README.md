# ⭐ Prework Study Guide Website ⭐ 

## Description ✏️

I was motivated to create this so I would have something to look back on as a guide.  This will help me remember the terms and I will be able to distinguish between HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  Git was new to me, but I learned a lot quickly!

## Installation 🔑

The only installation I needed to do was to sign up with GitHub, set-up my SSH keys, and ensure that the terminal and my computer were working well.

## Usage 🎯

This Study Guide will be used to help me remember what I need to know and review what I learned during the prework.  I will use it to help me review my notes, as-needed.  My Study Guide will help me to determine what I need to study.    

(TO BE COMPLETED LATER) open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).  A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.  There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
